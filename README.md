# FAIRXAI
## Modular Explainability for AI in Research


*FAIRXAI* is a platform developed within the Future Artificial Intelligence in Research (FAIR) initiative, designed to support the composition, execution, and explanation of modular AI decision-making processes.

Unlike traditional explainable AI tools that focus on individual models, FAIRXAI enables researchers and developers to describe and visualize the entire decision pipeline as a structured composition of interoperable modules. Each module contributes to the overall reasoning process and is associated with its own explanation method.

The platform empowers users to build transparent, traceable AI workflows that are aligned with the needs of scientific research, regulatory clarity, and human interpretability. FAIRXAI is the toolbox for making the next generation of AI systems not only powerful â€” but understandable.
